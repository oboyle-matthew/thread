These tests are made available "as is" with no warranties expressed or implied.  They are not supported.

I am making these available because I am soft (just a little) and I want to make things less burdensome for you (really!).   One downside of putting them out there is that it creates a risk that the class will post a flood of requests on Piazza of the form "why does it work that way" or "what does it mean when it says X" or (the worst) "why does the autograder say my heap is broken when it passes all the tests you gave us".

These are short programs that are self-explanatory if you take a few minutes to read them.   They are useful for starter testing, but we do not endorse them as examples of best practice or as reliable indicators of behavior.  A previous TA wrote these programs.  A later TA wrote better ones, but we use those for the autograder.

In particular, some reported failures are expected (e.g., the "stress" tests probe to fill the heap), and some reported performance metrics ("allocation failure rate") are dependent on context and are not particularly useful.   Some potential errors will not be exposed by these programs.  If you want to know what these tests do exactly, please read the source code.  It just takes a few minutes and it is instructive.  Feel free to modify these programs and share them around.
